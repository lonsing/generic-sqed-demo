TO BE UPDATED AND POLISHED

TODO: add appropriate license files for QED generator files, generated files and ridecore

- directory "ridecore-src-buggy": ridecore source files are obtained
  from GitHub at https://github.com/ridecore/ridecore and commit
  112a9bf24bf137344e89436c930c8d1220aaef60 (one off master) which
  still has the bug in the multiply decoder bug. This demo shows how
  we detect that bug using the generic QED module generated from an
  ISA specification file
